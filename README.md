### Description
This is a Web UI where you can search images using keywords.
You just enter keywords in the search bar available at the top, and the project will present you with several images from the database, that match your keyword.
You also get to view each image in its original size by clicking on the image or the zoom button at bottom-right of the respective image thumbnail.

The user also gets to select the number of search results to be displayed at a time on the webpage. This can be done from a drop-down menu, right below the search bar.

### Key Features
One of the key features is that the app searches in real-time as the user types in the keywords!
